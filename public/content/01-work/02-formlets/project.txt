Title: Formlets App & Brand

----

Short Name: Formlets

----

Intro: Formlets is the online form builder for everyone. With a transparent user interface and a warm, welcoming approach, Formlets wants to be the go-to answer for creating surveys and signups online. 

In late 2014, I was hired to design the initial interface and user experience for Formlets. Through the early months of 2015, fellow designer Matt Reyer and I prototyped features, designed their brand, and built the entire application and website from the ground up.

Title: Gazebo Marketing Site

----

Short Name: Gazebo.io

----

Intro: Gazebo is an automated payment release platform for banks and exporters. Powered by GPS tracking and a multi-signature blockchain release, payment is released to the seller automatically when a shipment is verified.

The founders of Gazebo came to me to design and build the first version of their marketing site. I created a fresh look and a snappy user experience that is a stand out in their largely homogeneous industry.

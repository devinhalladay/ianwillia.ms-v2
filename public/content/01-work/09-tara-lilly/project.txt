Title: Tara Lilly Portfolio

----

Intro: Tara Lilly is a Virginia based wedding photographer and designer capturing people and their stories. She loves grilled cheese, ice cream, dogs and hot pink. Patrick Carrell approached me in early 2013 about collaborating on Tara's personal site. We relied heavily on type and hand drawn illustrations to match her bold, yet kind visual style.

Intro: Hunter Dickenson is an exceptionally  talented artist and designer who heads up the art department at (link:http://www.presspressmerch.com text:Press Press Merch target:_blank class:cta), a Virginia based apparel company. His work is detailed and immaculate. When he's moonlighting, his focus is printmaking, tattoo design, leatherwork, and bike building. 

I was hired to build his brand and amplify his already articulate presence. Since then, we have collaborated on a series of logomarks that voice different aspects of his work.

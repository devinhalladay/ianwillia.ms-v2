			<h2><a id="Challenges_2"></a>Challenges</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Red Rooster vision and brand is not expressed coherently with current site, limiting the direction of growth in customer base.</li>
				<li>Various user experience issues remain unsolved on current site, preventing growth of online business. Resolving these issues becomes difficult because of vendor lock-in (using plugins developed by others rather than building custom solutions). Similarly, there are issues on the backend caused by the platform itself.</li>
				<li>Further diagnosis of other user experience issues are a shot in the dark. No analytics about customer behavior leaves you guessing about how to improve.</li>
				<li>Strategically use available capital: the end goal is to grow a business with customers you love, who love your product and vision. Allocate funds in a way that builds available capital long term.</li>
				<li>Platform fatigue: there is both a mental and financial cost to switching platforms frequently. Reducing this fatigue by picking a platform that can grow with Red Rooster is paramount.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><a id="Solutions_9"></a>Solutions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Incrementally diagnose current issues that are turning away customers. This can catch otherwise lost  sales from poor user experience without making a large up front investment.</li>
				<li>Create a more bespoke online experience that speaks to the customer base you desire long term.</li>
				<li>Increase customer engagement with both physical and online marketing pushes, customer analytics, and expansive community outreach.</li>

		<h2><a id="WooCommerce_Issues_16"></a>WooCommerce Issues</h2>
		<p>Some of the issues we spoke about previously include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Default order status “On Hold” rather than “Active” or “Pending”</li>
			<li>Duplicate and/or too frequent order emails</li>
			<li>Lack of shipping/tracking automation.</li>
			<li>Lack of error handling: if an issue occurs during checkout, you are unaware until a customer reaches out.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most of these problems can be fixed with relatively little time investment. The order status and email issues can be fixed within the WooCommerce settings. Tracking/Delivery notifications can be added with a plugin like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/aftership-woocommerce-tracking/">AfterShip</a>. There are many different error reporting solutions we could use to find out when a customer has a problem.</p>
		<p>All of these things should work well, but may not be the best fit long term.</p>

		<h2><a id="Picking_a_Platform_30"></a>Picking a Platform</h2>
		<p>This is the difficult part. As we discussed earlier this week, you can accomplish your goals with just about any platform, but they each come with their own advantages and challenges.</p>
		<h3><a id="Wordpress_33"></a>Wordpress</h3>
		<p>Wordpress was built originally as a blogging platform. It gained traction when people started using it for more than that (stores, complex web apps, news media sites).</p>
		<p>At it’s core, it is still a blogging platform. The way you organize data on the backend is still in the form of “blog posts”. When you add a product in WooCommerce, you’re still actually adding a blog post, but the plugin takes care of making appear as a product. All of this is fine when the end result works. That said, it gives you an idea of why things might feel strange or clunky on the backend: it is still made specifically for blogs.</p>
		<p>Wordpress’ plugin and theme system are why it as popular as it is today. You can install a theme and a few plugins and you have a brand new website. This has resulted in a huge and strong community, but also opens it up to being a target for malicious behavior. Over 23% of the top 10 million sites use Wordpress. That makes it an excellent target (Targeting one platform targets over 2 millions ites). There are whole <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/">websites</a> cateloguing Wordpress’ over 4000 security vulnerabilities.</p>
		<p>Even still, <em>huge</em> companies use Wordpress: Vogue, Quartz, Walt Disney, Clorox, Glad, Time … The point being, you can do a lot with it, despite it’s limitations. It is good software if you use it correctly.</p>
		<h4><a id="Pros_42"></a>Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Huge community, easier to find developers</li>
			<li>Many plugins to solve problems quickly</li>
			<li>Doesn’t mean migrating away from what you already have</li>
			<li>You can do everything you need to do to run an online shop in Wordpress.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><a id="Cons_48"></a>Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Constant updates to reduce security threats</li>
			<li>Wordpress developers often install plugins to solve problems, without having a deep understanding of what the plugin is doing. This would be an issue for anyone, me included.</li>
			<li>Deploying future changes can be complex and a pain.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a id="Alternates_Like_Craft_53"></a>Alternates Like Craft</h3>
		<p><a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft</a> is a CMS like Wordpress that has been gaining traction recently. The community is growing and large companies like Associated Press are using it. Unlike Wordpress, it was built without blogging in mind. It can do blogging, but it can also manage all kinds of other data without having to reconfigure the backend to use fake “blog posts”.</p>
		<p>It was also built with newer technologies in mind, so live preview and editing content on a mobile device comes standard.</p>
		<p>Craft is targeted to people building more custom websites. Developers are using Craft because they need that kind of control, and as a result, the community of developers has a much higher average skill level.</p>
		<h4><a id="Pros_60"></a>Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Built from the ground up for custom websites, not just blogs</li>
			<li>Higher caliber developer pool</li>
			<li>Websites are developed by hand, so you have fine control to make changes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><a id="Cons_65"></a>Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Less themes/plugins to solve problems quickly.</li>
			<li>Smaller developer pool to choose from</li>
			<li>Websites are developed by hand, so it takes longer.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a id="Outsourcing_The_Store_70"></a>Outsourcing The Store</h3>
		<p>One issue with including a store directly into the CMS backend is that you are locked into the plugin or store implementation. With WooCommerce, you can do as much as it will let you and no more. It also requires you to update the plugin every so often to thwart security threats. You can get around this by implementing your own custom backend, but that requires a lot of work to produce any meaningful result. This is great if you’re a large company and can afford the cost, but it’s not great for people getting started with online sales.</p>
		<p>An alternative to including a store directly in the website is that all of the management is handled for you. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> is an excellent example of this done well. You have very fine grain control over your stores look and behavior, but <em>they</em> manage the backend, security, backups, credit card processing, etc. You’re not awake late at night wondering if your store is still working. It is an extra cost to a website, but it can pay for itself in terms of what it can automate. I’ll focus on two features that I think are really important.</p>
		<p>First of all, because you have such control over the way the store looks, there can be virtually no difference between the way your store looks and the way the rest of your website looks, regardless of what you built your website in. Check out <a href="http://shop.fiftythree.com/">this example.</a>. This is the shop website for Fifty Three. They make apps for iPad and iPhone, but they also sell a really well designed stylus. The URL in the address bar is &quot;<a href="http://shop.fiftythree.com">shop.fiftythree.com</a>&quot;. This product page was hand built, and has some really great interactions, but is all on Shopify. Now click “PENCIL” in the menu bar in the top right. It looks like it’s a part of the same website, but it’s not. The URL is now just &quot;<a href="http://www.fiftythree.com">www.fiftythree.com</a>&quot;. Their shop is hosted at Shopify, and the rest of the website (with all of that custom design work and interactivity) is hosted elsewhere, and can be changed independently.</p>
		<p>The second thing I want to focus on is the automation it offers. <a href="https://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/notifications/default-templates">Here is a list</a> of all of the automatic email notifications you can turn on or off for customers. You can also design the emails to speak more to your brand, than the templates offered with WooCommerce. Also, shopify offers 1 step fulfillment, and automatic fulfillment when you get to that size. This means, when you receive an order, you can click one button “Fulfill”, you can purchase and print off the shipping label, and it will automatically email the customer with a tracking number and mark the order as to be shipped. And thinking long term, when you get to a size where it doesn’t make sense to do the fulfillment in house, they offer 3rd party integrations to do the fulfillment for you.</p>
		<h3><a id="Final_Word_on_Platforms_79"></a>Final Word on Platforms</h3>
		<p>I want to reiterate that you can do just about anything on Wordpress and on shared hosting. In addition to Wordpress, other platforms like Squarespace offer a higher caliber of design, and still allow you to sell products from the same CMS. All that said, my suggestion would be to fix the problems with the existing site, and work on building a new site on Craft and a store on Shopify. This combination offers the mix of fine grain control and 3rd party support that is required to build a sustainable online business.</p>

		<h2><a id="Design_84"></a>Design</h2>
		<p>One of the things we’ve talked about is that the current Red Rooster site feels like a blog and not a custom website. The biggest reason for that is because it uses a bought Wordpress theme. That isn’t to say your developer didn’t do a good job customizing it. Here are a few examples of other websites using the same theme:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/asee2015/">North Eastern University</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.familyscienceandengineering.org/">Foundation for Family Science</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.hfernando.com/en/contactar/">Hostal Fernando</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>These sites function well and serve their purpose, but they don’t necessarily present the unique qualities of the business or project. When your goal is to go after discerning customers who want to pay top dollar for amazing coffee, you have to sell them on the experience before they think about clicking the buy button. Here are examples of sites that, while not necessarily similar in aesthetic, represent their brand well, and sell you on an experience from the start. I would like to bring the same level of design to Red Rooster, as you’ve already done with your bags.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://swaywater.com/">http://swaywater.com/</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://oliverbrewingco.com/">http://oliverbrewingco.com/</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.cowandcocafe.com/">http://www.cowandcocafe.com/</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://pabloandrustys.com.au/">http://pabloandrustys.com.au/</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://sastairs.com.au/">http://sastairs.com.au/</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.restaurantebaobab.com/">http://www.restaurantebaobab.com/</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I’m sure you both have your own mental list of inspiring sites, and I would love to see them.</p>

		<h2><a id="Marketing_104"></a>Marketing</h2>
		<p>You’ve made really great traction in this department already. People around here know your name and love your coffee. You’re engaged with the community already on a pretty sizeable scale. I can’t claim expertise in this area, but I strongly suggest following up any launch of a new website with a corresponding online/offline campaign. We’ve spoken about SEO before, and this is the key to that. SEO is not nearly as important as real organic traffic to your site. That means clicking ads, people sharing your website on facebook, magazines and online publications linking to your site. SEO has become a sort of magical nonword in the marketing world that can sell clients on ineffective services. A few possible starts to this could be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Facebook ad campaigns give really fine demographic control over who you target (income, interests, etc). This kind of thing will probably move the needle the most</li>
			<li>Getting featured in food/coffee/maker culture publications can strongly associate your brand with national quality and not the “good enough for the region” trap.</li>
			<li>Partnering with other online companies to offer specials to their existing customer base.</li>
			<li>Travelling and spreading the word on foot, in a similar way to craft breweries. You can sell your coffee better than an ad.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h2><a id="Next_Steps_115"></a>Next Steps</h2>
		<p>The next thing we should do is talk about timeline, available budget, and what you desire to do first. The most effective timeline would be to put out immediate fires first, like the Wordpress and WooCommerce issues, and discuss how you would like to go about creating a custom site that hits your long term goals.</p>
		<p>All the best,
